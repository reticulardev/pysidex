Extras:

  A CSD (client side decoration) window without server side decoration (SSD). It is resizable in all corners and has a shadow (optional).

* QWindowControlButtons

  The buttons to close, maximize and minimize the window.

* QWindowMoveArea

  An area to drag the window. It is also possible to maximize and demaximize the window by double-clicking.

* QHeaderBar

  A ready-made header bar, with drag area (QWindowMoveArea), control buttons (QWindowControlButtons), the window icon and methods for adding widgets to its right and left.

  When possible, the control buttons respect the positioning settings, the global menu and the system theme. They also behave desirably when the window is full screen.

*The theme is still the PySide default
