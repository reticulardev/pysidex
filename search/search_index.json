Qt is an old and mature lib, but it was not originally designed to provide CSD support. Although it has added initial native support to CSD in recent years, it is still an incomplete work. Therefore, the PySideX and MPX projects are CSD implementations usable within the limits of Qt. So some hacks were made so that it was possible to have a usable window with desirable features such as a headerbar, customization of window borders, window control buttons with native platform integration, window resizing and movement. Targets There are necessary and some desirable goals to be met, and as a parameter, we use the \" Client-Side Decorations Initiative \" of the Gnome project as a necessary goal to be met. This initiative contains a reasonable list of targets that we were fortunately able to achieve: No title bar Native-looking close/maximize/minimize icons Respect the setting for showing/hiding minimize and maximize Respect the setting for buttons to be on the left/right side of the window Provide native system context menu on right click Limitations Desirable goals to be achieved are part of some limitations. Some of the Qt Company's difficulties in supporting CSD were addressed in article \" Custom client-side window decorations in Qt 5.15 \" on group blog. One of the details that has not yet been resolved is maintaining the window shadow when using the 'FramelessWindowHint' flag, which removes the server-side decorations. Another particularity to be resolved is the menu bar. As it is not rendered properly in the translucent part of the QMainWindow, which is modified to adapt the borders, it loses integration with global menus. Another inconvenience is windows with a blurred background. It's not impossible or very complicated to blur the background of the QMainWindow, but we had some pertinent problems with the window mask. It is not always able to remove the effect outside the rounded edges, leaving those little points slightly visible.
